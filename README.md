# Preskim

Preskim is a macOS PDF viewer with a modernized user interface and lots of useful functions. The development of Preskim is based upon the source code of Skim, which is BSD-Licensed. The app is still under heavy developments.

## Development Roadmap

- [X] A modernized and delicate user interface.

- [ ] A dark mode with the experience like the Dark Reader browser plugin.

## FAQ

**Why another PDF reader?**

- The commercial products, like PDF Expert, add too many irrelevant things into their app.
- The first-party original Preview app lacks fundamental functions.
- The original Skim app is good, but it hasn't yet adopted the new design language of macOS 11.0+.

**Why don't I contribute directly to the Skim app?**

I don't quite get used to the SourceForge platform and SVN way, so I choose to fork it from SourceForge and do on my own.

Thanks to the original authors for their contributions to the open source community. At the same time, I would like to pay my highest respect to Christiaan Hofman, as the Skim project has been going on for 16 years, but is still under continuous development.
